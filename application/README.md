The `./application` folder contains the main source code of the project.

It is organized as the following:

- The `lib/` folder contains helper scripts that will be used generally for the project (any additional general helper script will be put inside the `./lib` folder)
- The `routes/` folder contains the scripts that manage the hub. The appropriate action will be called within the URL (load an app, list apps,...)
